# Test Focus & Philosophy

- **UAT-Focused**: Write functional/behavioral tests that verify user acceptance criteria, not extensive unit-test-style coverage
- **Fewer Tests**: Prefer fewer, comprehensive tests over many small unit tests
- **Behavioral Testing**: Focus on end-to-end user scenarios and business workflows

# File Naming & Organization

## File Naming Conventions

- **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for all test files (e.g., `create-waste-movement.test.js`, `organisation-api-id.test.js`)
- **No CamelCase**: Avoid camelCase in test file names (e.g., `organisationApiId.test.js` should be `organisation-api-id.test.js`)
- **Descriptive Names**: Test file names should clearly indicate the feature being tested

## Directory Structure

- **Test Location**: Place tests in `test/specs/` directory organized by feature
- **Test Files**: Use `.test.js` extension for test files
- **Support Files**: Keep test utilities in `test/support/` directory
- **Group by Feature**: Organize tests by business domain, not technical implementation
- **Test Categories**: Use consistent describe block naming for test organization

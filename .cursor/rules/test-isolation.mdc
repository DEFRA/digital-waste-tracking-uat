# Test Isolation & Parallel Execution

- **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and runnable in isolation
- **Parallel-Safe**: Tests should be safe for parallel execution
- **No Shared State**: Avoid global state that could affect other tests
- **Fresh Test Data**: Each test should generate fresh test data in `beforeEach` (see test-data.mdc for details)
- **Resource Cleanup**: Let Jest handle cleanup automatically
- **Fresh API Instances**: Create fresh API instances in `beforeEach()` and cleanup in `afterEach()` (see jest-setup.mdc for details)

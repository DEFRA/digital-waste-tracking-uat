# Test Isolation & Parallel Execution

- **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and runnable in isolation
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests should be safe for parallel execution
- **No Shared State**: Avoid global state that could affect other tests
- **Fresh Data**: Each test should generate fresh test data in beforeEach
- **Resource Cleanup**: Let Jest handle cleanup automatically
